TA Stalker is an app that lets students know when their ta is in the office.  How it works is your TA uses IBM bluemix's LOT starter app to set their latitude and longitude.  Then a Node Red instance will ping the TA's phone and get their latitude and longitude location.  If the received cordinates are close enough to the set coordinates, the website will report that your TA is in the office!
